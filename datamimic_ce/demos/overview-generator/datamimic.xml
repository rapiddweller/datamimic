    Domains
    ======================================
    DATAMIMIC Entity demo showcases the various generators for multiple domains to
     create data e.g. for personal data, addresses, internet, banking, telecom. They may be localized to specific
    languages and be grouped into hierarchical datasets, e.g. for continents, countries, and regions.

    DATAMIMIC comes packaged with several entity types and generators for your business area.

    We are there to extend existing generators for your use-cases.
    Please get in touch via team@rapiddweller.com or our support channels.
