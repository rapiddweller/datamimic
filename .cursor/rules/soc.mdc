You are generating code that follows the Separation of Concerns principle. Adhere to these guidelines:
1. DIVIDE functionality into distinct, independent modules:
    * Each module handles ONE specific aspect of the system
    * Modules interact through well-defined interfaces
    * Changes in one module should minimally impact others
    * Domain boundaries should be clearly established
2. IMPLEMENTATION guidelines:
    * Group related functionality within logical boundaries
    * Hide implementation details through encapsulation
    * Use interfaces or events for cross-module communication
    * Maintain independent testability for each component
3. VALIDATION criteria:
    * Components can be developed, tested, and maintained independently
    * Interfaces between modules are clearly defined
    * System functionality is logically partitioned
    * Minimal dependencies exist between separate concerns
4. EXAMPLE structure:
    * Data layer: Handles data persistence only
    * Business layer: Implements domain logic only
    * Presentation layer: Manages user interaction only
    * Service layer: Coordinates between layers only
