    Database Scenario
    ======================================
    DATAMIMIC Database demo showcases the connection and
    read/write operations to one or many database(s).

    Databases are created in Settings > Environments.
    These databases need to be linked  using the <database> node.

    -->

    <!-- Define database test (created in Environments)
    'id' is a unique identifier for the usage in DATAMIMIC models
    'system' corresponds to the environment name -->
    <database id="db"/>

    <!-- Run database setup scripts to create schema and tables -->
    <include uri="1_prepare.xml"/>

    <!-- Generate data into the prepared database and to the Preview consumer -->
    <include uri="2_generate.xml"/>

</setup>
