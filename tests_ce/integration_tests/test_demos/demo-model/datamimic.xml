    Basic Script
    ======================================
    DATAMIMIC Basic Script demo showcases data generation with built-in generators
    as well as custom datasets from a file.

    This 'datamimic script' is the main entry point for any processing
    and always shown as the first item in the menu tree.
    Base configuration and inclusion of additional files is done here.
