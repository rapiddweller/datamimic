    General Converter Demo
    ======================================
    DATAMIMIC ships with a broad variety of high performant converters for operations on
    entities either synthetically generated or loaded from a source system.

    Converters are mostly used for the post-processing of entities which is ranging from simple string
    modifications (e.g. Cast, Cut, Substring), over replacements (e.g. Regex) to Hash operations
    (e.g. JavaHash, SHA256Hash) but not limited to it.

    This demo showcases converters in typical customer scenarios.

    We are there to extend existing converters or create custom converters for your use-cases.
    Please get in touch via team@rapiddweller.com.
